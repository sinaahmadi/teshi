## Teşî
#### A simple game for dialect identification

Teşî (meaning 'spindle' in Kurdish) is a simple game that detects your dialect based on a few questions about how you say certain words. Just as a spindle weaves threads together, dialects are beautifully interwoven, each contributing to the rich fabric of a language. Teşî is read as "tashi", rhyming with "flashy"!
